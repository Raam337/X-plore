## User Story:
* As a user seeking to use a social media platform where I can share recommendations and have the location displayed with an image of the place.



## Description:
* X-plore is a dynamic social media platform that seamlessly integrates the best features  offering users a unique and enriched experience for sharing moments, thoughts, and connecting with friends and followers. Whether you're an avid photographer, a prolific tweeter, or simply love to engage with others, X-plore provides a versatile platform for expression and interaction.

* The app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML, avaScrip, React and CSS powered by Netlify. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes even for sizes.

## Design:
We wanted to create an application that has a unique function but maintained the familiar elements seen across social media. We started with a simple wireframe to give us a visual guide for how we wanted our application to look.
